1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Ensure you have Python installed.
Google Gemini API Key: Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
2. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Vanshika300/smart-resume-analyzer.git

3. Configure API Key
Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project (the same directory as resume_analyzer.py). Add your Google Gemini API key to it:
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"


Important: Replace "YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your real key. This file is ignored by Git and will not be uploaded to GitHub, keeping your key secure.

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Run the Application
Once all dependencies are installed and your .env file is configured, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:
streamlit run resume_analyzer.py


This command will open the application in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.
